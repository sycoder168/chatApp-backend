# ChatApp Backend
This is the backend for a simple chat web application, built with Java and the Spring Framework. It leverages Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and Hibernate for database management, and provides WebSocket support for real-time messaging.

The server is secured using Spring Security and JWT-based authentication, ensuring that only authorized users can connect and exchange messages. It handles user authentication, WebSocket configuration, and message controllers to enable seamless and secure chat functionality.
